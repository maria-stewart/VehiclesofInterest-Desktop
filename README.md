Technologies Used: Java, NetBeans, Java Swing Leveraging Java, NetBeans, and Java Swing, I crafted a user-friendly interface tailored to the specific needs of law enforcement headquarters users creating a desktop application. I implemented robust features to track reasons for interest and vehicles of interest, enabling headquarters personnel to efficiently add, edit, and delete data as necessary. Additionally, I designed and implemented functionality to manage lists of vehicle makes and models, ensuring data accuracy and completeness. Through effective project management and technical expertise, I successfully delivered a functional desktop application meeting high-level requirements for tracking and managing vehicles of interest.
